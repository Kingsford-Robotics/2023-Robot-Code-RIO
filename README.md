# 2023-Robot-Code-RIO
 
This is the main code for Team 7154 TheROK for the 2023 Robotics season. The code is not finalized as the auton procedures need to be finished and there are parts that need to be cleaned up as it is still a work in progress. However, the code is primarily complete with most of the core functionality working satisfactorily.
